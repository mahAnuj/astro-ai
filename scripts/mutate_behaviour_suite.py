"""Mutation-test the behaviour suite: revert each fix, confirm the suite goes red.

A gate that has never failed is not evidence. Every mutation below restores,
verbatim, a defect that actually shipped into a commit and was caught by
review rather than by anything automated.

Run this after adding a test, and after any refactor of the code it guards.
Writing this harness immediately paid for itself: it found that two of the
concurrency tests reimplemented the logic inside the test body instead of
calling the real function, so they would have passed forever regardless of
what the code did. Two gates that could not fail, in the suite written to stop
exactly that.

It restores every file it touches, including on failure. It runs the WHOLE
suite per mutation, not the one test nominated in the table — the question is
"does the suite catch this", not "does the test I had in mind catch this", and
those differ: the `del` race is caught by a static guard in a different test
from the concurrency one.
