"""Registry of Vedic-astrology learning articles served at /learn/<slug>/.

Each article is a hand-written Jinja template at templates/learn/<slug>.html,
extending learn_article_base.html. The registry below holds the metadata
the index page + sitemap + structured-data need (title, summary, category,
hero image, FAQs).

Adding a new article = drop a new dict here + create the matching template
file under templates/learn/. No route changes; main.py resolves slug → file
lookup automatically.

We intentionally do NOT generate this content at runtime via LLM:
  - Static content compounds for SEO; LLM output has the AI-content stigma now
  - Authoritative human-written articles outrank generic LLM walls of text
  - Zero runtime LLM cost, zero "first visitor waits" problem
  - Easy to edit / version-control / improve over time

But cancellation can also happen via other placements — Mars in own sign, aspect from Jupiter, certain nakshatra combinations. A proper Kundli matching analysis matters more than the simple Manglik label.",

For marriage specifically, the Kumbh Vivah ceremony is mentioned in some traditions as a symbolic pre-marriage.",
